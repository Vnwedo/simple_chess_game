# Simple Chess Game

This is a simple, text-based chess game implemented in [Programming Language - e.g., Python]. It allows two players to play a standard game of chess in a terminal environment.

## Features

* **Standard Chess Rules:** Implements basic chess rules, including piece movement, captures, and basic checks.
* **Text-Based Interface:** Uses a simple text-based interface to display the chessboard and accept user input.
* **Turn-Based Gameplay:** Alternates turns between white and black players.
* **Basic Move Validation:** Validates player moves according to chess rules.
* **Game End Detection:** Detects checkmate and stalemate.

## How to Run

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * [Programming Language - e.g., Python 3.x] must be installed on your system.
2.  **Clone the Repository (Optional):**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    cd [repository directory]
    ```
3.  **Run the Game:**
    ```bash
    [execution command - e.g., python chess.py]
    ```
4.  **Follow the Prompts:** The game will display the chessboard and prompt you to enter moves using algebraic notation (e.g., "e2 e4").

## Game Controls

* **Move Input:** Enter moves in algebraic notation (e.g., "e2 e4" to move the pawn from e2 to e4).
* **Input Format:** The input should consist of two algebraic coordinates separated by a space.
* **Example Moves:**
    * `e2 e4` (Pawn from e2 to e4)
    * `Ng1 f3` (Knight from g1 to f3)
    * `Ra1 a8` (Rook from a1 to a8)

## Chessboard Representation

The chessboard is represented using a text-based grid. Each square is displayed with a piece symbol or an empty space.

* **Piece Symbols:**
    * `P` - Pawn
    * `R` - Rook
    * `N` - Knight
    * `B` - Bishop
    * `Q` - Queen
    * `K` - King
    * lowercase letters represent black pieces.
* **Example Board Output:**

    ```
      a b c d e f g h
    8 r n b q k b n r 8
    7 p p p p p p p p 7
    6 . . . . . . . . 6
    5 . . . . . . . . 5
    4 . . . . . . . . 4
    3 . . . . . . . . 3
    2 P P P P P P P P 2
    1 R N B Q K B N R 1
      a b c d e f g h
    ```

## Future Enhancements

* Implement more advanced chess rules (e.g., castling, en passant, pawn promotion).
* Add a graphical user interface (GUI).
* Implement AI opponent.
* Add better error handling for invalid input.
* Add a way to save and load games.
